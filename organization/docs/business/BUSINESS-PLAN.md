### Cost Structure & Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**

*Vendor CAC:*
```
Year 1:
- Marketing spend: $600K
- New vendors acquired: 500
- Vendor CAC: $1,200

Year 2:
- Marketing spend: $900K
- New vendors acquired: 1,500
- Vendor CAC: $600 (improving efficiency)

Target by Year 3: $400 per vendor
```

*Vendor Lifetime Value (LTV):*
```
Average vendor lifespan: 3 years
Average monthly subscription: $150
Average monthly GMV: $10,000
Average monthly commission: $1,200 (12%)
Total monthly revenue per vendor: $1,350

Vendor LTV = $1,350 × 36 months = $48,600
LTV:CAC Ratio = $48,600 / $1,200 = 40.5x (healthy)
```

*Customer CAC:*
```
Year 1:
- Marketing spend: $400K
- New customers: 50,000
- Customer CAC: $8

Year 2:
- Marketing spend: $1.4M
- New customers: 250,000
- Customer CAC: $5.60 (economies of scale)

Target by Year 3: $20-30 (industry standard)
```

*Customer Lifetime Value:*
```
Average customer lifespan: 2 years
Average orders per year: 6
Average order value: $75
Average gross merchandise value per customer: $900
Platform commission (12%): $108

Customer LTV = $108 × 2 years = $216
LTV:CAC Ratio = $216 / $8 = 27x (exceptional)

Note: As CAC increases to industry norms, ratio becomes:
$216 / $25 = 8.6x (still healthy; target is 3x+)
```
