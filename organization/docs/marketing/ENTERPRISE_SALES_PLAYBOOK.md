**Objection**: "We don't have budget this fiscal year."
- **Response**: "I understand budget constraints. When does your new fiscal year begin? In the meantime, we can set up a pilot at a reduced rate to prove ROI, making it easier to secure budget next year."

**Objection**: "We need Net 60/90 payment terms."
- **Response**: "Our standard terms are Net 30, but we can explore trade credit options through our financing partners. What's the total contract value? For larger deals, we may be able to accommodate extended terms."

**Objection**: "Can you include [custom feature] in this deal?"
- **Response**: "We appreciate the feedback on [feature]. While it's on our roadmap, we can't commit to a specific delivery date in this contract. However, I can connect you with our product team to discuss your requirements and timeline."
