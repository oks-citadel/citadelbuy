[Address]
Email: legal@broxiva.com

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

**Agreement to Arbitrate:**
You and Broxiva agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Platform, or products purchased (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except as set forth below.

Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is subject to very limited review by courts, and may be more limited than in court. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.

**Exceptions to Arbitration:**
The following are not subject to arbitration and may be brought in court:
1. Individual claims in small claims court (if within court's jurisdiction)
2. Claims for injunctive or equitable relief regarding intellectual property rights
3. Claims related to or arising from allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use

**Arbitration Rules and Forum:**
Arbitration will be conducted by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (or Commercial Arbitration Rules if you are acting as a business).

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.

**Arbitration Process:**
- The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.
- The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and binding.
- The arbitration will take place in [County, State] or another mutually agreed location.
- The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, video conference, or in person.
- Each party is responsible for its own attorney fees and costs unless the arbitrator awards them.

**Filing a Claim:**
To begin arbitration, submit a Demand for Arbitration to AAA and send a copy to Broxiva at the address above.

**Costs:**
- If your claim is for less than $10,000, Broxiva will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.
- If your claim is for $10,000 or more, the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
- Broxiva will not seek attorney's fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claim was frivolous.

### 17.3 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER:**
YOU AND BROXIVA AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

You and Broxiva agree not to participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or consolidated arbitration involving any other current or former users. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

**JURY TRIAL WAIVER:**
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND BROXIVA WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

Include your name, address, account email, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement. If you opt out, you and Broxiva can resolve disputes in court subject to Section 17.5.

### 17.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

**Governing Law:**
These Terms and any disputes are governed by the laws of the **State of [State], United States**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

**Jurisdiction:**
If arbitration does not apply or you have opted out, you agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [County, State], and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

### 17.6 Time Limitation on Claims

To the extent permitted by law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Platform must be filed within **one (1) year** after the claim or cause of action arose, or it will be permanently barred.

### 17.7 Severability of Dispute Resolution

If any provision of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will continue to apply, except that:
- If the Class Action Waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement (Section 17.2) is void, and Disputes will be resolved in court.
